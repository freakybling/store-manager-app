# store-manager-app
This is a small command-line app I built to solve a real-life problem for my friend's store. It helps manage perfumesâ€”keeping track of their name, stock, and price. You can add, search, update, and delete perfumes easily. All the data is stored locally in an SQLite database. Simple, fast, and gets the job done.
